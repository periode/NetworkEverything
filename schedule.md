#### Homework for Tuesday February 6  

**Do**

- Do the VirtualColorMixer example from the Arduino Communication examples,
	which sends multiple bytes from Arduino to Processing to control the color
	of the Processing canvas. 
	Refer to the Virtual Color Mixer
	[tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/VirtualColorMixer) but don't
	use the sensors it pictures; instead use the small blue potentiometers
	that are in your kit. 
	
	**If you are new to potentiometers please ask for
	help, either from me or someone in the lab** 

	If this example give you Nan (Not a Number) errors, replace
	`serialEvent()` with
		[this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/ArduinoExamples/blob/master/twoWayComms/improvedGraphSerialEvent/improvedGraphSerialEvent.ino)  

**Read**

	This is pretty detailed - you don't need to understand everything but try to
	familiarize yourself with the main concepts

	[tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ForLoopIteration)  
- Read and do the Arduino array
	[tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Arrays). Note that you can use
	the same circuit as the previous tutorial but double check the pin numbers  
- Install the Arduino WiFi101 library
	1. Open Arduino -> Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries

	5. Close the Library Manager  

- Upload and run the WiFi101 ScanNetworks example
	1. Open Arduino -> File -> Examples -> Wifi101 -> ScanNetworks
	2. Upload and run. You should see some WiFi networks 
	
(PIERRE: wifi101 allows you to connect to wifis + deal with HTTP requests)

#### Thursday February 8 9am - 11:40 (tentative)

	#define SECRET_PASS "michaelshiloh"    
````

#### Homework for Tuesday 13 February 2018 

- Read Designing Connected Products chapter 5  
- Read Making Things Talk chapter 3. There are a lot of technical details
	here. Don't worry about understanding them, just read and get a general
	sense of things.  
- Do again the Simple Web Server WiFi
	[tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Wifi101SimpleWebServerWiFi)  
- Do again the WiFi Web Server
	[tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Wifi101WiFiWebServer). 
	Start with the
	same circuit that we used in class (two light sensors and one momentary
	switch (pushbutton), and add three potentiometers to the other
	analog inputs. Remember to test each of these sensors individually before
	you attempt the web server.  

#### Tuesday 13 February 2018 9am - 10:15 

- Soldering and construction techniques

### current-homework-assignment

#### Homework due Thursday February 15 

**Design Project** 

Design an IoT device. It can be practical or silly, a game, or
anything else you fancy. You must tell a story as to why this device is
relevant, and design the sensors, actuators, and interface in a way that
fits this story.

* Describe your concept with a sketch and describe the sequence of events. 

* Describe in words or in a diagram how your program might be structured.

* Document your work in a file in your github repository

(PIERRE: we went through those in class on Feb 28 - all are > 90% functional)

**Introduction to Construction Techniques**

Build the circuit bellow on a perforated breadboard as we discussed in
class:

![](media/screwTerminalDigitalInput_schem.png)

* You may choose to use the switch that mounts on the breadboard and skip
the screw terminals, or use the screw terminals and solder wires to a panel
mounted switch.

* If you have used a different input already that's fine

* Use only stranded wire on the switch

* Use only solid core wire on the board

* Use red for 3.3V (or Vcc) and **nothing else**

* Use black for GND and **nothing else**

* Double check with a classmate or someone else that your circuit is correct
before plugging it in

* Test using the basic example DigitalReadSerial. Don't forget to change the
pin number to match your board.
